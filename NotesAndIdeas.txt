NOTES and IDEAS:

+ Mega clip of ALL screenshots:
	- make list of all files in chronological order using Processing sketch
	- run 'CopyAllFilesFromList.sh' to put them all in one folder
	- add black on sides of smaller images using:
			for f in *.png; do echo $(basename $f); convert $f -background black -gravity center -extent 853x430 $f; done
	- combine using: 
			ffmpeg -r 24 -pattern_type glob -i 'AllScreenshotFiles/*.png' -vcodec png EveryScreenshot.mov
	- compress out of PNG codec using Quicktime or MPEG Streamclip

+ Images to gather:
	- Tropes: computers behind people turned off, cops staring while someone uses computer, site/DB with big header, etc
	- Evolution of UI from all-text, early graphics, to fancy stuff
	- "Programs" really macros (from what? check S1 E21)

+ Things to write about:
	- Lenny as the computer doubter, reflecting a large part of the (older, esp) population at that time

+ By skipping the intro: 456 episodes x ~80 seconds means I saved 36,480 seconds, or 608 minutes, or ~ 10 hours
+ By watching at 150% speed: 456 episodes * 47 minutes = 21,432 minutes total * 0.25 = 5,358 minutes, 89.3 hours, or ~3.7 days

+ Episode (at least in season 1) is about 47 minutes with credits

+	Get list of all files tagged:
	
	Using tags:
	Law & Order - selected				For best of 5 screenshots
	Law & Order - best						For really exceptional screenshots
	
	Commands:
		mdfind -onlyin $sourceLocation 'tag:Red' | tee $outputDirectory
		mdfind -onlyin /Users/JeffThompson/Documents/Processing/AutomaticScreencapture/Screenshots/ 'tag:Law & Order - selected OR tag:Law & Order - best' | tee /Users/JeffThompson/Desktop/BestLawAndOrderScreenshots.txt

	Partially via http://brettterpstra.com/2013/10/28/mavericks-tags-spotlight-and-terminal
	... or using Tag (https://github.com/jdberry/tag)


+	Rec of each season's intro music (definitely changes midway through)
