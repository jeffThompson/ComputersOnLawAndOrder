Computers On Law & Order
======================

Hardware/software and related files for a project commissioned by Rhizome.org (thanks!) gathering images of computers and computer use on the American television series "Law & Order".  

*Why aren't the screenshots here?*  
Because there are 11,000 of them, and they're copyright NBC/Universal. If you'd like access to the archive for research purposes, [please just email me](http://www.jeffreythompson.org).

**Analyses And Ephemera**  
Notes, quotes, and some miscellaneous analyses of the show.

**Automatic Screencapture**  
Software for capturing screengrabs from VLC. Works by pausing your movie, takes a screenshot, advances by N frames (taking screenshots along the way), and starts the movie again! This sketch uses the Java AWT 'robot' class, which allows you to create virtual keystrokes (automatic keyboard shortcuts in VLC).

**Automatic Screencapture Button**   
Arduino code and hardware details for a touch-activated switch that triggers screencaptures in VLC. Includes information for building the switch.

**Auto Post To Tumblr**  
Python code for automatically posting images and quotes to Tumblr.

**Book**  
Files for the book, which includes an essay, some lists, and selected screenshots.

**Extract Text From Script**  
Tests in subtitle extraction from DVDs for text parsing and analysis.

**Misc And Process Files**  
Random Python scripts for fixing/updating, process screenshots, logos, etc.

**Notes and Ideas**  
Thoughts, citations, and various notes.

**Season And Episode List**  
List of episodes by season, episode number, episode name, and date aired.

**Tumblr Theme**  
Custom Tumblr theme for the project
