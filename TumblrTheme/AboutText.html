<h3>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h3>
<p><em>Computers on Law &amp; Order</em> tracks computers and computer use through all 456 episodes of the American crime drama <em>Law &amp; Order</em>. One episode posted per day.</p>

<p>The project was made possible from a generous commissioned from <a href="http://www.rhizome.org" target="_blank">Rhizome</a> (thank you!).</p>

<p>In the fall of 1990, a television program about crime, police investigation, and criminal trials named <em>Law &amp; Order</em> aired for the first time. The show eventually ended in 2010, tied with <em>Gunsmoke</em> for the longest-running live-action television show at 20 seasons and 456 episodes. With its unique (and consistent) style and trademark &ldquo;dun-dun!&rdquo; sound, <em>Law &amp; Order</em> has generated several spin-offs and can likely be found playing at any hour of the day somewhere on cable.</p>

<p>Much has been written recently about how &ldquo;binge watching&rdquo; an entire season or even an entire show is changing our interaction with – and in some cases the making of – television. This new TV-watching paradigm is due in large part to Netflix’s streaming service; around the same time it was launched, I started watching a lot of <em>Law &amp; Order</em>. With so many episodes available in an easy-to-digest procedural format, I could just turn to the next episode in line and hit &ldquo;play.&rdquo; I began to take screenshots of oddities: moments where the show broke from its usual format into first-person or split-screen views, or frames of unexpected abstraction as the camera panned across a scene.</p>

<p>But somewhere in all those procedurally-formatted murders, quips, investigations, interrogations, and trials I began noticing computers. At first they were oddities too (characters using computers in funny ways, interesting-looking fake applications or websites), but as many obsessive projects start, the more screenshots I took, the more I noticed computers.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2012, I received a commission from art and technology organization <a href="http://www.rhizome.org" target="_blank">Rhizome</a>, an affiliate of the New Museum in New York City, to more systematically document computers across the entire original <em>Law &amp; Order</em> series. I purchased the 120-disc box set and began to record (almost) every computer from all 456 episodes*. Now, a little more than a year later, nearly 11,000 screenshots have been gathered along with some related (and some not-so-related) data about the show. The project is presented in the form of this blog and in the more curated form of a book (link to a PDF to come shortly).</p>

<p><em>* Close to but not every computer: computers what appeared onscreen for only a single frame and were blurred or mostly cut off were not captured.</em></p>

<h3>A NOTE ON COPYRIGHT</h3>
<p>All images on this site are copyright <a href="http://nbcshop.nbcuniversalstore.com/search?w=law+and+order&amp;v=nbc" target="_blank">NBC/Universal</a>. While falling under fair use, if you enjoy these images from the show I encourage you to <a href="http://nbcshop.nbcuniversalstore.com/search?w=law+and+order&amp;v=nbc" target="_blank">buy the DVDs</a> and gather your own data!</p>

<p>This blog contains a lot of images, a total of approximately 2,550 screenshots. This may seem like a lot, but since the show&rsquo;s total length is 1,149,120 seconds, if multiplied by the standard video frame-rate of 29.97 frames/second the blog contains only 0.007% of the show&rsquo;s content. By comparison, that works out to about 100 milliseconds from each episode, or equivalent to taking a &frac12;-second clip from a feature film.</p>
