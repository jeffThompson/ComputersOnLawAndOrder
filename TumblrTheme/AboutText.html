<h3>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h3>
<p><em>Computers on Law &amp; Order</em> tracks computers and computer use through all 456 episodes of the American crime drama <em>Law &amp; Order</em>. One episode posted per day.</p>
<p>The project was made possible from a generous commissioned from <a href="http://www.rhizome.org" target="_blank">Rhizome</a> (thank you!).</p>

<p>About two years ago, I started watching a lot of the American television crime drama <em>Law &amp; Order.</em> It was readily at hand on Netflix&rsquo;s streaming service and with so many episodes available and a procedural format, I could just turn to the next episode in line and hit &ldquo;play&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303932504579254031017586624" target="_blank">Much has been written recently</a> about how &ldquo;binge watching&rdquo; entire shows changes our interaction with and in some cases the making of television. Watching pretty much all of the episodes of <em>Law &amp; Order</em> available on Netflix, I started to take screenshots of oddities, <a href="http://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2012/11/02/yesno" target="_blank">moments where the show broke from its usual format</a> into <a href="http://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2011/09/08/elliot-stablers-eyes" target="_blank">first-person or split-screen views</a>, or frames of unexpected abstraction as the camera panned across a scene.</p>
<p>But somewhere in all those procedural murders, quips, investigations, interrogations, and trials I began noticing computers. At first these computers were oddities too (characters using technology in funny ways, interesting-looking fake applications or websites), but as many obsessive projects start, the more screenshots I took the more I noticed computers and the cycle fed on itself.</p>
<p>I realized that <em>Law &amp; Order</em> forms a unique database of images and speech, and one that mirrors our current fascinations, fears, and biases. While an investigation of the show could take many forms, as an artist interested in how technology functions and shapes culture, using the show as a means to talk about our relationship to computers made perfect sense.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2012, I received a generous commission from <a href="http://www.rhizome.org" target="_blank">Rhizome</a>, an affiliate of the New Museum in New York City, to more systematically document computers on the original <em>Law &amp; Order</em> series. I purchased the 120-disc box set and began to record (nearly) every computer from all 456 episodes*. Now a year later, nearly 11,000 screenshots have been gathered along with some related (and some not-so-related) data about the show. The project is presented in the form of this blog and, in the more curated form of a book.</p>
<p>A special &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; goes to Michael Connor and Zo&euml; Salditch from <a href="http://www.rhizome.org" target="_blank">Rhizome</a> for their assistance making this possible and supporting what many would consider a pretty out-there proposal, and to the Museum of the Moving Image for hosting the launch of the project. NBC and the creators, actors, and crew of <em>Law &amp; Order</em> also deserve tremendous credit for creating such a lasting, at times quirky and problematic, but overall amazing document of the past 20 years of American culture.</p>

While falling under fair use, if you enjoy these images from the show I encourage you to <a href="http://nbcshop.nbcuniversalstore.com/search?w=law+and+order&amp;v=nbc" target="_blank">buy the DVDs</a> and gather your own data!</p>
<p>This blog contains a lot of images, a total of approximately 2,550 screenshots. This may seem like a lot, but since the show&rsquo;s total length is 1,149,120 seconds, if multiplied by the standard video frame-rate of 29.97 frames/second the blog contains only 0.007% of the show&rsquo;s content. By comparison, that works out to about 100 milliseconds from each episode, or equivalent to taking a &frac12;-second clip from a feature film.</p>
