Spanning 1990-2010 with 456 episodes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order">"Law & Order"</a> has no peers when it comes to following cultural and political trends through popular media. Because of its particular slice of time, one of the clearest shifts during the show's run is our relationship to technology. Over the course of the series, we see typewriters and word processors recede while computers begin to appear in the background of offices. They move onto people's desks, then are actively used onscreen. Crimes using computers, BBS systems, email, and databases start to appear. Internet and email communication become norms, and as the show closes in 2010 mobile computing is in constant use.
